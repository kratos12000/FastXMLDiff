This project was created as a functional tool for the comparison and editing of
XML documents.  It is a work in progress, designed to read in two XML documents
and compare them in a format similar to "diff". It marks when nodes have been
added, deleted or modified by adding new attributes to element nodes. This
project was created by Matthew Gaines and Amanda Buckley.
